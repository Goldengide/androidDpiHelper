This library helps you to resize your png image to xxxhdpi, xxhdpi, xhdpi, hdpi, mdpi, ldpi given that you put the xxxhdpi size of the image

For this to work on your PC you must have wamp or xamp server installed so that you can run the php file on it

Run the demo first before you start resizing your own image  to observe how it works.
